          <p className="chart1Text">Young adults are more and more likely to obtain a university degree, regardless of gender. However, women have made gains much more rapidly than men in recent years. In 1991, the proportion of men and women aged 25 to 34 with a university degree was about the same (at 16%); by 2011, the proportion had increased to 37% among women and 27% among men. As a result, 59% of all university graduates aged 25 to 34 in 2011 were female.

          The share of female university graduates increased in nearly all fields of study, including STEM programs. Hence, in 2011, 39% of STEM university graduates aged 25 to 34 were female, compared to 23% of STEM graduates aged 55 to 64.</p>

          <p className="chart2text">

            Furthermore, women with a STEM degree were particularly concentrated in science and technology programs. Specifically, women accounted for 59% of graduates who had a university degree in science and technology, but accounted for 23% of graduates aged 25 to 34 with a university degree in engineering, and 30% of those with a degree in mathematics and computer science. Thus, 39% of the 132,500 women aged 25 to 34 who had a STEM degree had a background in engineering, mathematics or computer science (Chart 1).Note7 In comparison, 72% of the 206,600 STEM-educated men had a background in these fields (47% in engineering and 25% in mathematics and computer science).</p>

            Women represented 66% of all non-STEM graduates aged 25 to 34 in 2011 (a proportion that was in the 80% range in health professions and related programs, and in education programs). Women were thus proportionately under-represented among STEM graduates, at least compared with other fields. Men with a STEM university degree were also less likely than non-STEM graduates to be working in occupations requiring a high school education or lessâ€”a form of 'skills mismatch'. Among men aged 25 to 34 with a STEM university degree, 12% were in occupations generally requiring a high school diploma or less, compared with 22% among those with a non-STEM university degree. Among women, 18% of STEM graduates were in occupations requiring a high school diploma or less, a percentage that was very similar to that of women with a non-STEM university degree.</p>
